I want to explore the golden ratio, I do not know much about it but have discovered that it seems to incorporate several different elements from our class (partial fractions, algorithms, and plotting) My goal will be to explore how and where it can be found in other elements of math and to then compare the similarities using SAGE. For example, the golden ration and the Fibonacci sequence have some close similarities. And I am currently working on writing some code that will graph the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ration.. (I think this is possible?) Additionally to using SAGE to compare it with other algorithms, I also plan on looking at proofs and origins of the golden ratio. I believe it can be found in Euclidean geometry.

Paper (so far)
==============

The golden ratio, a phenomenal number, that has prevalence in almost everything the mind can think of. This number has gained the attention of many mathematicians and individuals of different disciplines dating back to several hundred BC. The first possible discovery of the golden ration lies in the Parthenon, a Greek temple built in 447BC. Whether the structures embodiment of the golden ratio is by chance or not is a still debated subject. Euclid (325BC â€“ 265BC) provided the first known written definition of the golden ration, although he did not refer it as that at the time. At this point the ratio has been researched and explored by countless mathematicians. 
  What is the golden ratio and what makes it so special? The ratio, by assumption, was first discovered and researched because its very common occurrence in geometry such as the construction of a pentagon. However, what really makes this number is its occurrence in not only math but in biology, art, music, history, architecture and even psychology.
