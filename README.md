Overall Topic
=============

I want to explore the golden ratio, I do not know much about it but have discovered that it seems to incorporate several different elements from our class (partial fractions, algorithms, and plotting) My goal will be to explore how and where it can be found in other elements of math and to then compare the similarities using SAGE. For example, the golden ration and the Fibonacci sequence have some close similarities. And I am currently working on writing some code that will graph the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ration.. (I think this is possible?) Additionally to using SAGE to compare it with other algorithms, I also plan on looking at proofs and origins of the golden ratio. I believe it can be found in Euclidean geometry.
